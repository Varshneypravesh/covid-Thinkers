A web application to help students in education during covid crisis.

Remote Education: With the comprehensive shut-down of schools and facilities to exercise social distancing, students are forced to stay at home for an indeterminate amount of time. How do we ensure that learning does not stop for them? Remote education is paramount in ensuring that our students keep learning.

During the covid crisis many private and government organisation came forward to offer resources to help students so that they can continue their studies from home but many students are yet unaware about these offerings so we decided to make a web application which contains all the resources and important information at a single place so that they can benefit from these resources and continue their studies.

Developer community is also responding to the covid19 strongly and there are also many events and hackathons are organised by big and small companies to deal with the situation and give something for society.

There is also a problem students are dealing with that due to lockdown in many countries many final year students are not able to get placement but due to unawareness or lack of information they might not know that many companies are offering online placement drives in which students can appear and get placement. 

This app contains the feature so that students can register on this app and they get the notification via msg and email if there is any oppurtunity for them.
